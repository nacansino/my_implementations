# Generic Heap
This is a Heap data structure that supports abstract data types/user data types.

-  This is a part of the my_implementations repo: https://github.com/nacansino/my_implementations

## Basic Features:

### Heap(int mode)
- this is the constructor
- initializes a heap with a specified mode of operation
- set mode to 0 for a minimum heap, and any integer other than zero to initialize a maximum heap.
### front()
- views the max/min of the heap
### push()
- inserts an element in the heap
- heap automatically adjusts elements inside such that the heap property is satisfied.
### pop()
- return and remove the max/min of the heap
